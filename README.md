# face_recognition-Arc-Face-Additive-Angular-Margin-Loss
This is a tensorflow implementation of paper "ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition". Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace) is used to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. The proposed ArcFace has a clear geometric interpretation due to the exact correspondence to the geodesic distance on the hypersphere. This implementation aims at making both usage of pretrained model and training of your own model easier. Whether you just want to use pretrained model to do face recognition/verification or you want train/finetune your own model.
